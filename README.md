## Inspiration

Most Android phones come pre-installed with Google Play Music. The phones running customized Android skins also offer their music players. While both of them do a superb job, they are mostly bloated.
So downloading a heavy, feature-rich music player app doesnâ€™t make sense. A simple, lightweight music player app that plays offline songs with basic features is enough. Such apps can also come in handy for anyone with a large offline collection who doesnâ€™t want to deal with extra features.

### Description

A light weight music player app to play local music files on an Android phone. The alternatives to Google Play Music , weigh less than 5MB and have no ads. No fancy features. Nothing. The app is a simple music player that shows tabs such as Artists, Albums, Songs. You can use them to view your music files in an organized manner.

## How we built it

Using Android Studio and java.

## Challenges we ran into
